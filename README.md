## Scope & Goals of Analysis

This SQL-based project explores sales performance and operational efficiency for a fictitious global electronics retailer. The primary objective is to simulate the types of data questions a business analyst or operations team might explore using transactional data in a *normalized relational database.*

Using PostgreSQL and pgAdmin 4, the project focuses on querying and transforming data to surface insights relevant to sales trends, customer behavior, and store performance, while also reinforcing core SQL concepts such as **filtering, aggregation, joining, window functions, and subqueries.**

The **main objectives** of this analysis are to:
1. Analyze average order value (AOV) by store
2. Identify seasonal sales trends
3. Join exchange rates to calculate USD revenue


## Dataset & Overview of Data Structure

This project explores a relational database representing transactional and operational data for a fictitious global electronics retailer. The dataset was sourced from Maven Analytics and consists of 5 CSV files containing over 60,000 sales records across a network of international stores. The primary goal of this project is to practice end-to-end SQL data modeling, analysis, and transformation using PostgreSQL and pgAdmin 4.

The dataset emulates a normalized schema suitable for business intelligence use cases, including customer behavior, product sales performance, and currency-based revenue tracking. The database schema follows a star schema structure, with the sales table serving as the central fact table.
